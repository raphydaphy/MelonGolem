  "parchment.arcanemagic.drowned_discovery_1": "I am writing this to record an unusual species which I discovered whilst swimming today. It featured many of the same properties as the Zombies I have seen countless times before, but it was blue and thrived underwater. When I killed it, the particles released looked very different to anything I am used to. In order to study this further I will need to kill more of them and document my findings once I reach a conclusion.",
  "parchment.arcanemagic.drowned_discovery_2": "Since my last entry, I have killed several of the drowned zombies, but the particles dissipated before I could study them properly. I theorize that killing them whilst they stand on a sufficiently dense object such as this altar I have designed may stabilize the particles, at least temporarily.",
  "parchment.arcanemagic.wizard_hut_1": "The rest of us have already left the area. Many of them seek refuge under the water where the Anima cannot dissipate, but we will continue our research on the Expansion for as long as we can. Unfortunately half our group have already transformed into Zombies - the aura is becoming far too thin to survive. If you are reading this, we have started our journey to the community center in hopes of finding the survivors. Do not try to harness the power in the aura."
